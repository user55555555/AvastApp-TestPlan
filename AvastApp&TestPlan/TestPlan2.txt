1 INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this STP is to develop a test plan to assess all functionalities of a VPN app named X-VPN on Android.

2 TEST PLAN

2.1 Items Under Test
The app will consist of three basic area of testing. The first item of testing is whether a user can sign in or sign up. The second item accessed is whether a user can select a preferred location/server. The third item under test is whether the app's performance is as expected.

2.2 Scope
The scope of this document is to test X-VPN by each component, component integration, and full system functionality. However, due to the lack of available project time, this document will only include functional testing.

2.3 Test Devices and Environments 
Pixel 3 with Android version 6.0
Nexus 6 with Android version 10.0

2.4 Resource Materials
X-VPN Software Configuration Management Plan
X-VPN Software Requirements Specification 
X-VPN Software Quality Assurance Plan  
X-VPN Software Design document   

2.5 Test Categories

2.5.1 Unit Testing
This process involves the testing of particular system components. These components are isolated from other portions. 

2.5.2 Integration Testing
Integration testing procedures incorporate system components and how they perform together functionally between one another.

2.5.3 System Testing
This involves the complete integration of all system components and how they perform as a whole unit. 

2.5.4 Performance Testing 
The test checks if the app's performance meets business needs. It includes connection speed, download speed, network coverage, etc.

2.6 Acronyms
